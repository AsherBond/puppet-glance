    The ``glance::api`` class accepts a new parameter ``public_endpoint``.
    This is especially useful if you have a proxy or load balancer that
    rewrites the base URL of the image API.  If the image API is advertised as
    ``https://cloud.acme.org/api/image`` in Keystone, you will need to set
    this option to the full value of the endpoint to have glance API
    advertise the correct URLs to clients.
