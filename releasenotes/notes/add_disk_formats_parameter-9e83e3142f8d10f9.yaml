    Added disk_formats option which allows configuration of
    the image_format/disk_formats config setting; some backends
    perform poorly with specific disk formats, for example
    Ceph with QCOW2 images and in these scenarios it might
    be useful to filter out of the allowed disk formats those
    which are unwanted.
